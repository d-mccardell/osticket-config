<p>
Make sure you are logged on to the virtual machine that has osTicket. 
</p>
<br />

<p>Log in to osTicket with your credentials.</p>
<br/>

<p>
In the admin panel you can create roles. Roles are the permissions assigned to agents in different departments.. Each role can have different permissions and access depending on department. To create a role click on Admin Panel--> Agents--> Roles--> click on Add a New Role. 
</p>
<br />
<br/>

<p>
In this case, we will create a role named "Supreme Admin" with complete access and permissions to all tickets, tasks, and knowledgebase.
</p>
<br />
<br/>

<p>Next, we wil add departments. Since tickets can be routed to different departments, each department can have a different set of settings such as SLA and ticket assignment. <br/>
Here, we have created a "systems administrators" departments with default settings.
<br/> To add a department go to Admin Panel--> Agents--> Departments--> Add New Department.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Next, add a team. Teams allow you to pull agents from different departments to handle certain tickets. In this instance, we have created a Level II Support team. <br/> To add a team go to Admin Panel--> Agents--> Teams--> Add New Team</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Now we will add agents. Agents can be given different levels of access when adding them. <br/> To add a new agent go to Admin Panel--> Agents--> Agents--> Add New Agent. </p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Make sure to assign a primary department to the new agent.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Next we will add users. Users are the ticket owners of the tickets in the help desk.
<br/>
To add users got to Agent Panel--> Users--> User Directory--> Add User</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Now we will add SLA or Service Level Agreements.The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed.<br/>
To add a SLA go to Admin Panel--> Manage--> SLA--> Add New SLA Plan</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Finally, we will add Help Topics. Help Topics will help streamline your end-userâ€™s help desk experience to ensure proper assignment and prompt response to the ticket.
<br/>
To add Help Topics simply got to Admin Panel--> Manage--> Help topics--> Add New Help Topic</p>
